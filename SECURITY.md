# Seucirty Policy

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions. For the full security policy, please visit <https://policy.recaptime.tk/security>.

## PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING AN SECURITY REPORT

Since we're synchorizing this fork to `gitpod-io/workspace-images` on daily to weekly basis, we recommend report any issues that also affect the upstream at <https://www.gitpod.io/security>.

Otherwise if this happens in our images within the `gitpodified-workspace-images` Quay namespace, please contact the maintainers below.
